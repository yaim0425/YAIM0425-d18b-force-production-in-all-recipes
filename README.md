# YAIM0425 d18b – Force Production in All Recipes ⚙️📈

## 📦 Description

**YAIM0425 d18b – Force Production in All Recipes** allows **productivity modules to affect all recipes**, including those that are normally excluded in vanilla Factorio.

This MOD removes standard restrictions and forces productivity bonuses to apply universally, enabling higher output from every production chain.

It is especially useful for megabases, experimental factories, and players who want maximum production efficiency.
